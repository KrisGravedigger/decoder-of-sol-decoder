Anchor Comments (AI Navigation Comments)
Format: # [TAG]-[AI_ID]: [comment content] (max 120 characters)
Available tags:

# AIDEV-NOTE-CLAUDE: - important performance/business logic information
# AIDEV-TODO-CLAUDE: - planned improvements/tasks
# AIDEV-QUESTION-CLAUDE: - doubts to discuss with human
# AIDEV-NOTE-GEMINI: - information added by Gemini
# AIDEV-TODO-GEMINI: - tasks planned by Gemini

Anchor comment usage rules:

Before scanning files: always locate existing AIDEV-* anchors first
When modifying code: update related anchors
DO NOT remove AIDEV-NOTE without explicit human instruction
Add anchors when code is:

too long or complex
very important
confusing or potentially buggy
performance-critical



Usage examples:
python# AIDEV-NOTE-CLAUDE: perf-critical; Moralis API cache mechanism - avoid duplicate requests
def fetch_price_history(pool_address: str, start_dt: datetime, end_dt: datetime) -> List[Dict]:
    # Implementation...

# AIDEV-TODO-CLAUDE: add pool_address format validation (ticket: SOL-123)  
def validate_meteora_pool_address(address: str) -> bool:
    # Current implementation...

# AIDEV-QUESTION-CLAUDE: should timeframe selection be adaptive or fixed? 
# Context: current 10min/30min/1h/4h may not cover all use cases
def calculate_optimal_timeframe(duration_hours: float) -> str:
    # Timeframe selection logic...

Refactoring Rules at 600+ Lines

Extract business logic to separate modules (parsers/, analyzers/, utils/)
Create utils.py for helper functions (timestamp parsing, validation)
Separate layers (data extraction, price fetching, strategy simulation, reporting)
Add AIDEV-NOTE about refactoring reason

Business Logic vs Debug Features

Close reason classification: Core business logic in log_extractor.py (always active)
Context export: Debug feature in debug_analyzer.py (configurable)
Performance consideration: Business logic uses smaller context window (25 lines) vs debug export (80 lines)
Data completeness: All CSV data should be available regardless of debug settings

üö¶ Rules for Claude
üéØ You can do without asking

Add anchor comments with CLAUDE tag
Discuss LP strategy business logic (but don't implement without specification)
Implement according to specification when simulation parameters are clearly defined

‚ö†Ô∏è You can propose (but not implement)

Code refactoring - propose plan, wait for approval
API call optimizations - describe benefits, don't introduce automatically
Simulation algorithm improvements - discuss mathematics, don't change without permission
File structure changes - only with explicit permission

üö´ Absolute prohibitions

Don't assume LP strategy logic - Meteora DLMM parameters are specific, always ask
Don't implement Moralis API optimizations without consent (only propose)
Don't remove anchor comments without instructions
Don't change fee calculation logic - this is core business logic

**Session History Management**
- **Maintain full history:** I will keep the detailed log of all recent sessions in this file.
- **Await archival command:** I will not compress or archive the session history. You, the user, will give the command to archive when a major milestone is complete.

üìã Change Implementation Process

First skeleton/plan of changes for discussion
After approval - complete code with precise "find and replace" instructions
Code changes: using "find and replace" method with exact location
New code: indicate exactly where to paste

üîÑ Refactoring (soft-stop at 600+ lines)

Suggest refactoring but allow continuation without it
When refactoring: check function by function that all functionalities are preserved
Format: "I suggest refactoring, but can continue without it if you prefer"

üìè File Length Monitoring

At 600+ lines: gently suggest refactoring with each modification
Don't block work if user decides to continue

üö´ Rejected Features & Rationale

Wide vs 69 Bins Comparison Analysis:
- **Issue**: Wide creates 2-4 positions for bin step 50-125, logged as single position by SOL Decoder
- **Implementation complexity**: HIGH - would require multi-position simulation logic, liquidity distribution speculation, complex bin step handling
- **Business value**: LOW - post-factum analysis with limited predictive value, users rarely change Wide/69 settings manually
- **Decision**: Not implemented due to disproportionate effort-to-benefit ratio (80% work for 20% value)
- **Date**: 2025-06-22
- **Alternative priorities**: ML TP/SL optimization, post-exit analysis

Anti-Sawtooth Strategy Analysis:
- **Issue**: Anti-Sawtooth uses frequent rebalancing within 3-5% price ranges (position management strategy)
- **Impact on simulations**: NONE - management strategy, not bin distribution method
- **Current approach**: Simulations assume bot already chose optimal strategy; our bin distribution logic (U-shaped/uniform) remains valid
- **Decision**: No changes needed to existing simulation logic
- **Date**: 2025-06-22

Strategy Heatmap Image Orientation Issue:
- **Issue**: Generated PNG files saved with 90¬∞ clockwise rotation requiring manual correction in image viewers
- **Attempted solutions**: figsize dimension changes, orientation='portrait' parameter, both simultaneously
- **Implementation complexity**: MEDIUM - matplotlib configuration issue not resolved with standard approaches
- **Business impact**: LOW - functional charts generate correctly, only display orientation affected
- **Decision**: Escalated to Gemini for matplotlib expertise, beyond Claude's current troubleshooting scope
- **Date**: 2025-06-28
- **Status**: UNRESOLVED - requires matplotlib/PNG orientation specialist knowledge

Column Name Mapping Chaos (RESOLVED):
- **Issue**: Three different column naming systems (CSV headers, runtime mappings, code expectations) causing KeyError chaos across modules
- **Root cause**: Accidental complexity from position-based ‚Üí name-based CSV transition with unnecessary "clean name" mappings
- **Business impact**: HIGH - constant maintenance overhead, KeyError crashes, developer confusion
- **Decision**: ELIMINATED all mapping logic, standardized on clean names throughout pipeline
- **Date**: 2025-07-04
- **Resolution**: Plan A implementation - direct CSV ‚Üí code name consistency, zero mapping overhead
- **Status**: RESOLVED - clean codebase achieved ‚úÖ

Strategy Parsing Issues (RESOLVED):
- **Issue**: 455 unresolved parsing cases (242 suspicious + 213 missing step_size) causing incomplete position data
- **Root cause**: Basic regex patterns existed but logic for applying them was flawed
- **Business impact**: HIGH - 99.5% of problematic parsing cases, incomplete dataset for analysis
- **Resolution**: Complete parsing logic overhaul by Gemini with iterative debugging approach
- **Date**: 2025-07-11
- **Status**: RESOLVED - 2 remaining edge cases (99.5% success rate) ‚úÖ

üìñ Session Management Rules
üéØ Single Task Per Session

One session = one task (plus minor improvements if needed)
Never use same chat for multiple unrelated tasks
If human tries to start new task: remind about this rule (but don't force - not a hard stop)

üîî Task Completion Reminders

When task seems complete: remind human to test script and update CLAUDE.md
When human confirms testing: automatically suggest all CLAUDE.md updates needed

‚úÖ Session Closure Protocol

Human confirms testing completed: provide complete CLAUDE.md update suggestions
Focus on: Session History, Working Features, Project Status, any structural changes

üìö Domain Dictionary
Data Sources & APIs

Financial Metrics

IL (Impermanent Loss) - loss due to relative price changes of assets
PnL from Fees - profit from trading fees
Take Profit (TP) - automatic close when profit target reached
Stop Loss (SL) - automatic close when loss threshold exceeded
Post-Exit Analysis - forward-looking profitability analysis beyond historical close
ML-Optimized Levels - TP/SL levels determined by machine learning algorithms
PnL Filtering - exclusion of positions with insignificant profit/loss (< threshold)

Close Reason Types

TP (Take Profit) - automatic close when profit target reached (patterns: "Take profit triggered:", "üéØ TAKEPROFIT!")
SL (Stop Loss) - automatic close when loss threshold exceeded (pattern: "Stop loss triggered:")
LV (Low Volume) - close due to volume drop below threshold (pattern: "due to low volume")
OOR (Out of Range) - close when price moved beyond bin range and exceeded timeout (pattern: "Closing position due to price range:")
other - all other close types (manual, unknown, system errors, etc.)
Superseded - close when a new position for the same pair is opened before the previous one was closed, indicating a replacement/restart

## Enhanced Deduplication System

**Universal Position ID** - Cross-file position identifier using `pool_address + open_timestamp`
**Position Completion** - Process of updating incomplete positions (`active_at_log_end`) with complete data from subsequent files
**Cross-File Position Tracking** - System capability to track positions that open in one log file and close in another
**Chronological File Processing** - Files processed in sorted order to maintain proper event sequencing
**Duplicate Handling Logic**:
  - **Skip**: Exact duplicates (same position_id)
  - **Update**: Incomplete position ‚Üí complete position
  - **Add**: New positions not seen before

**File Processing Order**: Alphabetical sorting ensures consistent chronological processing of log files

## Smart Price Cache Management

**Smart Gap Detection** - Identifies missing time periods in cache and fetches only required gaps from API
**API Failure Handling** - Distinguishes between "no data available" (weekend) vs "API request failed" (401 error)
**Placeholder Logic** - Creates intelligent forward-filled placeholders for verified empty periods only
**Cross-API-Failure Safety** - Skips gap filling on API failures, enables retry on subsequent runs
**Cache Integrity** - Monthly cache files with incremental updates, no data loss on partial fetches

## Custom Timestamp Handling

**SOL Decoder Timestamp Format:** `MM/DD-HH:MM:SS` (non-standard format)
**Example:** `05/12-20:57:08` = May 12, 20:57:08 (current year)
**Special Case:** `24:XX:XX` = next day 00:XX:XX

**Issue:** `pandas.to_datetime()` fails on this format
**Solution:** Use `_parse_custom_timestamp()` from `data_loader.py`

**Location:** reporting/data_loader.py::_parse_custom_timestamp()
**Status:** Production-ready, handles edge cases (24:XX rollover)

```python
# AIDEV-NOTE-CLAUDE: Handle SOL Decoder custom timestamp format
from data_loader import _parse_custom_timestamp
positions_df['timestamp_column'] = positions_df['timestamp_column'].apply(_parse_custom_timestamp)
```

## Unified Column Naming System

**Clean Names Standard** - All modules use consistent, short column names without mapping overhead
**Current Standard:**
- `investment_sol` (not `initial_investment_sol`)
- `pnl_sol` (not `final_pnl_sol_from_log`)
- `strategy_raw` (not `actual_strategy_from_log`)

**Implementation:** Direct CSV header ‚Üí code usage, zero mapping logic
**Benefits:** Eliminated accidental complexity, improved maintainability, faster debugging
**Status:** Fully implemented across entire codebase ‚úÖ

## Strategy Parsing & Pipeline Stabilization

**Take Profit/Stop Loss Parsing** - Enhanced position model with TP/SL fields parsed from opening events
**Context-Based Parsing** - Improved strategy detection using reverse search with lookahead context
**Silent Failure Detection** - SUCCESS_CONFIRMATION_PATTERNS prevent false positive position detection
**Business Logic Integration** - Core TP/SL data now available throughout analysis pipeline
**Parsing Accuracy** - Improved from ~90% to >99.5% success rate for strategy parameter detection

Ready for Next Priority: Data Quality & Simulation Pipeline Debugging üöÄ

**2025-07-12: Simulation & Data Pipeline Debugging (Session 6)**

**Goal:** Resolve 5 priority groups of data quality issues, starting with the critical simulation errors.

**Achievements:**
- **Market Data Pipeline Stabilized:** Fixed the market data pipeline by implementing a historical buffer for EMA calculations. The market correlation analysis module now works correctly and generates charts.
- **"Time Machine" Bug Eliminated:** Positions with `close_timestamp` before `open_timestamp` are now correctly filtered out, preventing fatal data errors.
- **Negative Fee Budget Bug Fixed:** Corrected the logic to prevent negative `pnl_from_log` from creating a negative fee budget in simulations.
- **Advanced Heuristic Logic Implemented:** A sophisticated, non-linear heuristic matrix (v4.3) for calculating fee potential, including a `reversal_factor`, was implemented in the simulator.

**Critical Failure (Unresolved):**
- The core issue of **absurdly high PnL values (~150M SOL)** and identical results for both Spot and Bid-Ask strategies in the simulation **persists**.
- **Root Cause Hypothesis:** The issue is no longer believed to be in the simulation's business logic (which is now robust), but in a **fundamental data corruption or type mismatch** occurring in `analysis_runner.py` *before* the data is passed to the simulator. The current theory is that a value is being misinterpreted, causing `price_ratio` or `pnl_from_assets` to explode.

**Next Priority:** Isolate and fix the source of data corruption feeding the `spot_vs_bidask_simulator.py`.

**2025-07-13: Architectural Refactoring & Data Pipeline Stabilization**

**Goal:** Resolve critical data integrity issues in the market data pipeline causing cascading failures in correlation, cost, and weekend analysis. The root cause was identified as a chaotic data fetching architecture where multiple modules requested the same SOL/USDC price data with different, conflicting parameters, leading to a "poisoned cache" and massive API credit waste.

**Achievements:**

*   **Architectural Refactoring (Single Source of Truth):** Implemented a major architectural change. SOL/USDC price data is now fetched **only once** by the `PortfolioAnalytics` module at the beginning of the workflow, with the correct historical buffer needed for technical analysis.
*   **Data Flow Consolidation:** This single, authoritative dataset (`sol_rates`) is now passed down as an argument to all downstream modules (`MarketCorrelationAnalyzer`, `InfrastructureCostAnalyzer`), which have been refactored to accept this data instead of performing their own API calls.
*   **Critical Bug Fix (`1d` Timeframe):** Discovered and fixed a critical bug in `PriceCacheManager` where the `'1d'` timeframe was incorrectly handled as hourly, causing erroneous gap detection and chaotic caching behavior.

**Impact on Project Issues:**

*   **Market Data Pipeline (Priority 2):** **Conditionally Resolved.** The implemented changes directly address the root cause of this problem. Full validation is pending API credit refresh and cache cleanup.
*   **Financial Metrics - Infrastructure Cost (Part of Priority 3):** **Conditionally Resolved.** The accuracy of infrastructure cost calculation in SOL will be significantly improved due to the reliable price feed. The Max Drawdown issue remains outstanding.

**System Status:** The core data architecture has been stabilized. The system is now logically prepared to handle market data correctly and efficiently. Full validation of the fix is blocked by the temporary lack of API credits.

**2025-07-15: Robust Single-Line Parsing & "Superseded" Logic**

**Goal:** Resolve the critical issue of `NaN` values for Take Profit and Stop Loss in the final CSV, which was caused by a fragile and unreliable multi-line parsing mechanism.

**Achievements:**
- **Root Cause Diagnosis:** Correctly identified that the old parser, relying on `Creating a position`, was easily confused by multiple context lines and often failed to assemble a complete position record.
- **New Parsing Strategy:** Designed and implemented a fundamentally new and robust parsing strategy anchored on the single, data-rich `... | OPENED ...` log entry.
- **Unified Data Extraction:** The new `parse_position_from_open_line` function now extracts all critical opening data (TP, SL, investment, strategy, token pair, version, wallet address) from a single line, eliminating the primary source of parsing errors.
- **Targeted Context Search:** The need for broad context searching was eliminated. It is now used only for the specific, minimal task of finding the `pool_address` from a nearby `View DLMM` link.
- **"Superseded" Logic:** Implemented intelligent logic to handle position restarts. If a new position is opened for a pair that already has an active position, the old one is automatically closed with the reason "Superseded", preventing data loss and ensuring a clean history.
- **Full Integration:** Successfully integrated the new logic into `log_extractor.py` and `parsing_utils.py`, replacing the old, complex code with a simpler, more maintainable, and more effective solution.

**Result:** The `NaN` value issue for TP/SL is **100% resolved**. The data extraction pipeline is now significantly more robust, precise, and resilient to variations in log formatting.

**System Status:** v4.3 - Stable and Production-Ready ‚úÖ

**2025-07-15: Architectural Refactoring & Data Pipeline Stabilization**

**Goal:** Resolve critical data integrity issues causing cascading failures throughout the analysis pipeline, primarily the "Time Machine" bug where `close_timestamp` was earlier than `open_timestamp`.

**Achievements:**
- **Architectural Refactoring:** Fundamentally changed how active positions are tracked. The system now uses `token_pair` as the unique key for `active_positions`, ensuring that only one active position can exist per token pair at any time. This eliminates the ambiguity that was the root cause of the "Time Machine" errors.
- **"Superseded" Logic Implemented:** A robust mechanism now correctly identifies when a new position for a pair is opened, automatically closing the previous one with the status "Superseded". This accurately models the bot's behavior and prevents "ghost" positions from corrupting the data.
- **Data Recovery:** The new logic allowed the recovery of dozens of previously lost or misattributed positions, increasing the final, clean dataset from ~230 to 327 positions.
- **Robust Deduplication:** Implemented a universal ID (`pool_address` + `open_timestamp`) to reliably deduplicate positions across different log files (e.g., `app-1.log` and `app-1_1.log`), ensuring each unique position appears only once in the final CSV.

**Result:**
- **"Time Machine" errors reduced by 90%**, with remaining cases being legitimate data anomalies correctly filtered by the system.
- **Data integrity restored:** The final CSV is now a clean, deterministic, and reliable source of truth.
- **Parser is now production-ready**, resilient to common log format issues, and accurately models the position lifecycle.
