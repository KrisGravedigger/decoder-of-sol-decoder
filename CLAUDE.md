# CLAUDE.md - SOL Decoder Strategy Analyzer

## 🌐 Language Policy
**CRITICAL RULE**: Regardless of conversation language, ALL code updates and CLAUDE.md modifications must be in English. This ensures consistency in codebase and documentation.

## 🎯 Project Objectives
### Main Goals
- [ ] **Bot Performance Analysis** - Extract position data from SOL Decoder bot logs
- [ ] **LP Strategy Optimization** - Simulate alternative Meteora DLMM strategies for found positions  
- [ ] **Strategy Ranking** - Identify best strategy combinations for different market conditions
- [ ] **Analysis Automation** - Complete pipeline from logs to comparative reports
- [ ] **TP/SL Optimization** - ML-driven optimization of take profit and stop loss levels
- [ ] **Post-Exit Analysis** - Forward-looking profitability analysis beyond historical close points

### Project Success Criteria
**MVP (current)**: Tool generates relative strategy rankings for each position with accuracy sufficient for trend and pattern identification.

**Long-term**: System provides reliable strategic recommendations with precise financial simulations and ML-optimized TP/SL levels.

## 📋 Coding Conventions

### Structure and Organization
- **Maximum file length:** 600 lines of code
- **When file exceeds 600 lines:** time for refactoring (split into modules)
- **Naming:** snake_case for functions/variables, PascalCase for classes

### Documentation
- **Docstrings:** Mandatory for all functions and classes
- **Docstring format:** Google style with complete parameter and return value descriptions
- **Example:**
```python
def fetch_price_history(pool_address: str, start_dt: datetime, end_dt: datetime) -> List[Dict]:
    """
    Fetch price history for a pool from Moralis API.
    
    Args:
        pool_address (str): Meteora pool address to fetch prices for
        start_dt (datetime): Start datetime for price range
        end_dt (datetime): End datetime for price range
        
    Returns:
        List[Dict]: Price data with 'timestamp' and 'close' keys
        
    Raises:
        requests.RequestException: When API call fails
        ValueError: When datetime range is invalid
    """
```

### Anchor Comments (AI Navigation Comments)
**Format:** `# [TAG]-[AI_ID]: [comment content] (max 120 characters)`

**Available tags:**
- `# AIDEV-NOTE-CLAUDE:` - important performance/business logic information
- `# AIDEV-TODO-CLAUDE:` - planned improvements/tasks  
- `# AIDEV-QUESTION-CLAUDE:` - doubts to discuss with human
- `# AIDEV-NOTE-GEMINI:` - information added by Gemini
- `# AIDEV-TODO-GEMINI:` - tasks planned by Gemini

**Anchor comment usage rules:**
- **Before scanning files:** always locate existing `AIDEV-*` anchors first
- **When modifying code:** update related anchors
- **DO NOT remove `AIDEV-NOTE`** without explicit human instruction
- **Add anchors when code is:**
  - too long or complex
  - very important
  - confusing or potentially buggy
  - performance-critical

**Usage examples:**
```python
# AIDEV-NOTE-CLAUDE: perf-critical; Moralis API cache mechanism - avoid duplicate requests
def fetch_price_history(pool_address: str, start_dt: datetime, end_dt: datetime) -> List[Dict]:
    # Implementation...

# AIDEV-TODO-CLAUDE: add pool_address format validation (ticket: SOL-123)  
def validate_meteora_pool_address(address: str) -> bool:
    # Current implementation...

# AIDEV-QUESTION-CLAUDE: should timeframe selection be adaptive or fixed? 
# Context: current 10min/30min/1h/4h may not cover all use cases
def calculate_optimal_timeframe(duration_hours: float) -> str:
    # Timeframe selection logic...
```

### Refactoring Rules at 600+ Lines
- **Extract business logic** to separate modules (parsers/, analyzers/, utils/)
- **Create utils.py** for helper functions (timestamp parsing, validation)
- **Separate layers** (data extraction, price fetching, strategy simulation, reporting)
- **Add AIDEV-NOTE** about refactoring reason

## 🚦 Rules for Claude

### 🎯 You can do without asking
- **Add anchor comments** with CLAUDE tag
- **Discuss LP strategy business logic** (but don't implement without specification)
- **Implement according to specification** when simulation parameters are clearly defined

### ⚠️ You can propose (but not implement)
- **Code refactoring** - propose plan, wait for approval
- **API call optimizations** - describe benefits, don't introduce automatically
- **Simulation algorithm improvements** - discuss mathematics, don't change without permission
- **File structure changes** - only with explicit permission

### 🚫 Absolute prohibitions
- **Don't assume LP strategy logic** - Meteora DLMM parameters are specific, always ask
- **Don't implement Moralis API optimizations** without consent (only propose)
- **Don't remove anchor comments** without instructions
- **Don't change fee calculation logic** - this is core business logic

### 📋 Change Implementation Process
1. **First skeleton/plan** of changes for discussion
2. **After approval** - complete code with precise "find and replace" instructions
3. **Code changes:** using "find and replace" method with exact location
4. **New code:** indicate exactly where to paste

### 🔄 Refactoring (soft-stop at 600+ lines)
- **Suggest refactoring** but allow continuation without it
- **When refactoring:** check function by function that all functionalities are preserved
- **Format:** "I suggest refactoring, but can continue without it if you prefer"

### 📏 File Length Monitoring
- **At 600+ lines:** gently suggest refactoring with each modification
- **Don't block work** if you decide to continue

## 📖 Session Management Rules

### 🎯 Single Task Per Session
- **One session = one task** (plus minor improvements if needed)
- **Never use same chat** for multiple unrelated tasks
- **If human tries to start new task:** remind about this rule (but don't force - not a hard stop)

### 🔔 Task Completion Reminders
- **When task seems complete:** remind human to test script and update CLAUDE.md
- **When human confirms testing:** automatically suggest all CLAUDE.md updates needed

### ✅ Session Closure Protocol
- **Human confirms testing completed:** provide complete CLAUDE.md update suggestions
- **Focus on:** Session History, Working Features, Project Status, any structural changes
