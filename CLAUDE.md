Anchor comment usage rules:

Before scanning files: always locate existing AIDEV-* anchors first
When modifying code: update related anchors
DO NOT remove AIDEV-NOTE without explicit human instruction
Add anchors when code is:

too long or complex
very important
confusing or potentially buggy
performance-critical



Usage examples:
python# AIDEV-NOTE-CLAUDE: perf-critical; Moralis API cache mechanism - avoid duplicate requests
def fetch_price_history(pool_address: str, start_dt: datetime, end_dt: datetime) -> List[Dict]:
    # Implementation...

# AIDEV-TODO-CLAUDE: add pool_address format validation (ticket: SOL-123)  
def validate_meteora_pool_address(address: str) -> bool:
    # Current implementation...

# AIDEV-QUESTION-CLAUDE: should timeframe selection be adaptive or fixed? 
# Context: current 10min/30min/1h/4h may not cover all use cases
def calculate_optimal_timeframe(duration_hours: float) -> str:
    # Timeframe selection logic...

Refactoring Rules at 600+ Lines

Extract business logic to separate modules (parsers/, analyzers/, utils/)
Create utils.py for helper functions (timestamp parsing, validation)
Separate layers (data extraction, price fetching, strategy simulation, reporting)
Add AIDEV-NOTE about refactoring reason

Business Logic vs Debug Features

Close reason classification: Core business logic in log_extractor.py (always active)
Context export: Debug feature in debug_analyzer.py (configurable)
Performance consideration: Business logic uses smaller context window (25 lines) vs debug export (80 lines)
Data completeness: All CSV data should be available regardless of debug settings

🚦 Rules for Claude
🎯 You can do without asking

Add anchor comments with CLAUDE tag
Discuss LP strategy business logic (but don't implement without specification)
Implement according to specification when simulation parameters are clearly defined

⚠️ You can propose (but not implement)

Code refactoring - propose plan, wait for approval
API call optimizations - describe benefits, don't introduce automatically
Simulation algorithm improvements - discuss mathematics, don't change without permission
File structure changes - only with explicit permission

🚫 Absolute prohibitions

Don't assume LP strategy logic - Meteora DLMM parameters are specific, always ask
Don't implement Moralis API optimizations without consent (only propose)
Don't remove anchor comments without instructions
Don't change fee calculation logic - this is core business logic

**Session History Management**
- **Maintain full history:** I will keep the detailed log of all recent sessions in this file.
- **Await archival command:** I will not compress or archive the session history. You, the user, will give the command to archive when a major milestone is complete.

📋 Change Implementation Process

First skeleton/plan of changes for discussion
After approval - complete code with precise "find and replace" instructions
Code changes: using "find and replace" method with exact location
New code: indicate exactly where to paste

🔄 Refactoring (soft-stop at 600+ lines)

Suggest refactoring but allow continuation without it
When refactoring: check function by function that all functionalities are preserved
Format: "I suggest refactoring, but can continue without it if you prefer"

📏 File Length Monitoring

At 600+ lines: gently suggest refactoring with each modification
Don't block work if user decides to continue

🚫 Rejected Features & Rationale

Wide vs 69 Bins Comparison Analysis:
- **Issue**: Wide creates 2-4 positions for bin step 50-125, logged as single position by SOL Decoder
- **Implementation complexity**: HIGH - would require multi-position simulation logic, liquidity distribution speculation, complex bin step handling
- **Business value**: LOW - post-factum analysis with limited predictive value, users rarely change Wide/69 settings manually
- **Decision**: Not implemented due to disproportionate effort-to-benefit ratio (80% work for 20% value)
- **Date**: 2025-06-22
- **Alternative priorities**: ML TP/SL optimization, post-exit analysis

Anti-Sawtooth Strategy Analysis:
- **Issue**: Anti-Sawtooth uses frequent rebalancing within 3-5% price ranges (position management strategy)
- **Impact on simulations**: NONE - management strategy, not bin distribution method
- **Current approach**: Simulations assume bot already chose optimal strategy; our bin distribution logic (U-shaped/uniform) remains valid
- **Decision**: No changes needed to existing simulation logic
- **Date**: 2025-06-22

Strategy Heatmap Image Orientation Issue:
- **Issue**: Generated PNG files saved with 90° clockwise rotation requiring manual correction in image viewers
- **Attempted solutions**: figsize dimension changes, orientation='portrait' parameter, both simultaneously
- **Implementation complexity**: MEDIUM - matplotlib configuration issue not resolved with standard approaches
- **Business impact**: LOW - functional charts generate correctly, only display orientation affected
- **Decision**: Escalated to Gemini for matplotlib expertise, beyond Claude's current troubleshooting scope
- **Date**: 2025-06-28
- **Status**: UNRESOLVED - requires matplotlib/PNG orientation specialist knowledge

📖 Session Management Rules
🎯 Single Task Per Session

One session = one task (plus minor improvements if needed)
Never use same chat for multiple unrelated tasks
If human tries to start new task: remind about this rule (but don't force - not a hard stop)

🔔 Task Completion Reminders

When task seems complete: remind human to test script and update CLAUDE.md
When human confirms testing: automatically suggest all CLAUDE.md updates needed

✅ Session Closure Protocol

Human confirms testing completed: provide complete CLAUDE.md update suggestions
Focus on: Session History, Working Features, Project Status, any structural changes

PnL Filtering - exclusion of positions with insignificant profit/loss (< threshold)

Close Reason Types

TP (Take Profit) - automatic close when profit target reached (patterns: "Take profit triggered:", "🎯 TAKEPROFIT!")
SL (Stop Loss) - automatic close when loss threshold exceeded (pattern: "Stop loss triggered:")
LV (Low Volume) - close due to volume drop below threshold (pattern: "due to low volume")
OOR (Out of Range) - close when price moved beyond bin range and exceeded timeout (pattern: "Closing position due to price range:")
other - all other close types (manual, unknown, system errors, etc.)

## Custom Timestamp Handling

**SOL Decoder Timestamp Format:** `MM/DD-HH:MM:SS` (non-standard format)
**Example:** `05/12-20:57:08` = May 12, 20:57:08 (current year)
**Special Case:** `24:XX:XX` = next day 00:XX:XX

**Issue:** `pandas.to_datetime()` fails on this format
**Solution:** Use `_parse_custom_timestamp()` from `data_loader.py`

**Location:** reporting/data_loader.py::_parse_custom_timestamp()
**Status:** Production-ready, handles edge cases (24:XX rollover)

```python
# AIDEV-NOTE-CLAUDE: Handle SOL Decoder custom timestamp format
from data_loader import _parse_custom_timestamp
positions_df['timestamp_column'] = positions_df['timestamp_column'].apply(_parse_custom_timestamp)

**2025-07-02: Major Refactoring and UI Enhancement**

**Goal:** Refactor oversized modules (`portfolio_main.py`, `html_report_generator.py`) to adhere to project standards and add an interactive user menu for ease of use.
**Achieved:**

- **Major Refactoring (Code Modularity):**
  - `html_report_generator.py` was refactored by extracting its large HTML template into `reporting/templates/comprehensive_report.html` and moving all Plotly chart creation logic to a new, dedicated module: `reporting/visualizations/interactive_charts.py`. This significantly improved maintainability.
  - `portfolio_main.py` was split into two distinct files, separating the user interface from the core logic:
    - `orchestrator.py`: Now contains the `PortfolioAnalysisOrchestrator` class, serving as the pure logic engine for the analysis workflow.
    - `portfolio_main.py`: Re-created as the main command-line entry point, featuring an interactive menu and argument parsing. It now imports and uses the `PortfolioAnalysisOrchestrator`.

- **UI Enhancement (Interactive Menu):**
  - Implemented a user-friendly interactive menu in the new `portfolio_main.py`. This allows users to select analysis modes (comprehensive, quick, period-specific) without needing to memorize command-line arguments, improving accessibility.
  - Retained the command-line argument functionality for automation and power-user workflows.

- **Improved Project Structure:**
  - The overall project structure is now cleaner and more aligned with the single-responsibility principle. The new files fit logically within the established directory layout (`templates/`, `visualizations/`).

**System Status:** Portfolio Analytics v3.2 - Refactored and User-Friendly. The codebase is now more maintainable, scalable, and easier to use. ✅
