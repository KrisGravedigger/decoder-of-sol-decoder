def calculate_optimal_timeframe(duration_hours: float) -> str:
    # Timeframe selection logic...

Refactoring Rules at 600+ Lines

Extract business logic to separate modules (parsers/, analyzers/, utils/)
Create utils.py for helper functions (timestamp parsing, validation)
Separate layers (data extraction, price fetching, strategy simulation, reporting)
Add AIDEV-NOTE about refactoring reason

Business Logic vs Debug Features

Close reason classification: Core business logic in log_extractor.py (always active)
Context export: Debug feature in debug_analyzer.py (configurable)
Performance consideration: Business logic uses smaller context window (25 lines) vs debug export (80 lines)
Data completeness: All CSV data should be available regardless of debug settings

🚦 Rules for Claude
🎯 You can do without asking

Add anchor comments with CLAUDE tag
Discuss LP strategy business logic (but don't implement without specification)
Implement according to specification when simulation parameters are clearly defined

⚠️ You can propose (but not implement)

Code refactoring - propose plan, wait for approval
API call optimizations - describe benefits, don't introduce automatically
Simulation algorithm improvements - discuss mathematics, don't change without permission
File structure changes - only with explicit permission

🚫 Absolute prohibitions

Don't assume LP strategy logic - Meteora DLMM parameters are specific, always ask
Don't implement Moralis API optimizations without consent (only propose)
Don't remove anchor comments without instructions
Don't change fee calculation logic - this is core business logic

**Session History Management**
- **Maintain full history:** I will keep the detailed log of all recent sessions in this file.

📏 File Length Monitoring

At 600+ lines: gently suggest refactoring with each modification
Don't block work if user decides to continue

🚫 Rejected Features & Rationale

Wide vs 69 Bins Comparison Analysis:
- **Issue**: Wide creates 2-4 positions for bin step 50-125, logged as single position by SOL Decoder
- **Implementation complexity**: HIGH - would require multi-position simulation logic, liquidity distribution speculation, complex bin step handling
- **Business value**: LOW - post-factum analysis with limited predictive value, users rarely change Wide/69 settings manually
- **Decision**: Not implemented due to disproportionate effort-to-benefit ratio (80% work for 20% value)
- **Date**: 2025-06-22
- **Alternative priorities**: ML TP/SL optimization, post-exit analysis

Anti-Sawtooth Strategy Analysis:
- **Issue**: Anti-Sawtooth uses frequent rebalancing within 3-5% price ranges (position management strategy)
- **Impact on simulations**: NONE - management strategy, not bin distribution method
- **Current approach**: Simulations assume bot already chose optimal strategy; our bin distribution logic (U-shaped/uniform) remains valid
- **Decision**: No changes needed to existing simulation logic
- **Date**: 2025-06-22

Strategy Heatmap Image Orientation Issue:
- **Issue**: Generated PNG files saved with 90° clockwise rotation requiring manual correction in image viewers
- **Attempted solutions**: figsize dimension changes, orientation='portrait' parameter, both simultaneously
- **Implementation complexity**: MEDIUM - matplotlib configuration issue not resolved with standard approaches
- **Business impact**: LOW - functional charts generate correctly, only display orientation affected
- **Decision**: Escalated to Gemini for matplotlib expertise, beyond Claude's current troubleshooting scope
- **Date**: 2025-06-28
- **Status**: UNRESOLVED - requires matplotlib/PNG orientation specialist knowledge

Column Name Mapping Chaos (RESOLVED):
- **Issue**: Three different column naming systems (CSV headers, runtime mappings, code expectations) causing KeyError chaos across modules
- **Root cause**: Accidental complexity from position-based → name-based CSV transition with unnecessary "clean name" mappings
- **Business impact**: HIGH - constant maintenance overhead, KeyError crashes, developer confusion
- **Decision**: ELIMINATED all mapping logic, standardized on clean names throughout pipeline
- **Date**: 2025-07-04
- **Resolution**: Plan A implementation - direct CSV → code name consistency, zero mapping overhead
- **Status**: RESOLVED - clean codebase achieved ✅

Strategy Parsing Issues (RESOLVED):
- **Issue**: 455 unresolved parsing cases (242 suspicious + 213 missing step_size) causing incomplete position data
- **Root cause**: Basic regex patterns existed but logic for applying them was flawed
- **Business impact**: HIGH - 99.5% of problematic parsing cases, incomplete dataset for analysis
- **Resolution**: Complete parsing logic overhaul by Gemini with iterative debugging approach
- **Date**: 2025-07-11
- **Status**: RESOLVED - 2 remaining edge cases (99.5% success rate) ✅

📖 Session Management Rules
🎯 Single Task Per Session

One session = one task (plus minor improvements if needed)
Never use same chat for multiple unrelated tasks
If human tries to start new task: remind about this rule (but don't force - not a hard stop)

🔔 Task Completion Reminders

When task seems complete: remind human to test script and update CLAUDE.md
When human confirms testing: automatically suggest all CLAUDE.md updates needed

✅ Session Closure Protocol

Human confirms testing completed: provide complete CLAUDE.md update suggestions
Focus on: Session History, Working Features, Project Status, any structural changes

Financial Metrics

IL (Impermanent Loss) - loss due to relative price changes of assets
PnL from Fees - profit from trading fees
Take Profit (TP) - automatic close when profit target reached
Stop Loss (SL) - automatic close when loss threshold exceeded
Post-Exit Analysis - forward-looking profitability analysis beyond historical close
ML-Optimized Levels - TP/SL levels determined by machine learning algorithms
PnL Filtering - exclusion of positions with insignificant profit/loss (< threshold)

Close Reason Types

TP (Take Profit) - automatic close when profit target reached (patterns: "Take profit triggered:", "🎯 TAKEPROFIT!")
SL (Stop Loss) - automatic close when loss threshold exceeded (pattern: "Stop loss triggered:")
LV (Low Volume) - close due to volume drop below threshold (pattern: "due to low volume")
OOR (Out of Range) - close when price moved beyond bin range and exceeded timeout (pattern: "Closing position due to price range:")
other - all other close types (manual, unknown, system errors, etc.)

## Enhanced Deduplication System

**Universal Position ID** - Cross-file position identifier using `pool_address + open_timestamp`
**Position Completion** - Process of updating incomplete positions (`active_at_log_end`) with complete data from subsequent files
**Cross-File Position Tracking** - System capability to track positions that open in one log file and close in another
**Chronological File Processing** - Files processed in sorted order to maintain proper event sequencing
**Duplicate Handling Logic**:
  - **Skip**: Exact duplicates (same position_id)
  - **Update**: Incomplete position → complete position
  - **Add**: New positions not seen before

**File Processing Order**: Alphabetical sorting ensures consistent chronological processing of log files

## Smart Price Cache Management

**Smart Gap Detection** - Identifies missing time periods in cache and fetches only required gaps from API
**API Failure Handling** - Distinguishes between "no data available" (weekend) vs "API request failed" (401 error)
**Placeholder Logic** - Creates intelligent forward-filled placeholders for verified empty periods only
**Cross-API-Failure Safety** - Skips gap filling on API failures, enables retry on subsequent runs
**Cache Integrity** - Monthly cache files with incremental updates, no data loss on partial fetches

## Custom Timestamp Handling

**SOL Decoder Timestamp Format:** `MM/DD-HH:MM:SS` (non-standard format)
**Example:** `05/12-20:57:08` = May 12, 20:57:08 (current year)
**Special Case:** `24:XX:XX` = next day 00:XX:XX

**Issue:** `pandas.to_datetime()` fails on this format
**Solution:** Use `_parse_custom_timestamp()` from `data_loader.py`

**Location:** reporting/data_loader.py::_parse_custom_timestamp()
**Status:** Production-ready, handles edge cases (24:XX rollover)

```python
# AIDEV-NOTE-CLAUDE: Handle SOL Decoder custom timestamp format
from data_loader import _parse_custom_timestamp
positions_df['timestamp_column'] = positions_df['timestamp_column'].apply(_parse_custom_timestamp)
```

## Unified Column Naming System

**Clean Names Standard** - All modules use consistent, short column names without mapping overhead
**Current Standard:**
- `investment_sol` (not `initial_investment_sol`)
- `pnl_sol` (not `final_pnl_sol_from_log`)
- `strategy_raw` (not `actual_strategy_from_log`)

**Implementation:** Direct CSV header → code usage, zero mapping logic
**Benefits:** Eliminated accidental complexity, improved maintainability, faster debugging
**Status:** Fully implemented across entire codebase ✅

## Strategy Parsing & Pipeline Stabilization

**Take Profit/Stop Loss Parsing** - Enhanced position model with TP/SL fields parsed from opening events
**Context-Based Parsing** - Improved strategy detection using reverse search with lookahead context
**Silent Failure Detection** - SUCCESS_CONFIRMATION_PATTERNS prevent false positive position detection
**Business Logic Integration** - Core TP/SL data now available throughout analysis pipeline
**Parsing Accuracy** - Improved from ~90% to >99.5% success rate for strategy parameter detection

**2025-07-02: Major Refactoring and UI Enhancement**

**Goal:** Refactor oversized modules (`portfolio_main.py`, `html_report_generator.py`) to adhere to project standards and add an interactive user menu for ease of use.
**Achieved:**

- **Major Refactoring (Code Modularity):**
  - `html_report_generator.py` was refactored by extracting its large HTML template into `reporting/templates/comprehensive_report.html` and moving all Plotly chart creation logic to a new, dedicated module: `reporting/visualizations/interactive_charts.py`. This significantly improved maintainability.
  - `portfolio_main.py` was split into two distinct files, separating the user interface from the core logic:
    - `orchestrator.py`: Now contains the `PortfolioAnalysisOrchestrator` class, serving as the pure logic engine for the analysis workflow.
    - `portfolio_main.py`: Re-created as the main command-line entry point, featuring an interactive menu and argument parsing. It now imports and uses the `PortfolioAnalysisOrchestrator`.

- **UI Enhancement (Interactive Menu):**
  - Implemented a user-friendly interactive menu in the new `portfolio_main.py`. This allows users to select analysis modes (comprehensive, quick, period-specific) without needing to memorize command-line arguments, improving accessibility.
  - Retained the command-line argument functionality for automation and power-user workflows.

- **Improved Project Structure:**
  - The overall project structure is now cleaner and more aligned with the single-responsibility principle. The new files fit logically within the established directory layout (`templates/`, `visualizations/`).

**2025-07-02: Weekend Parameter Analysis v2.1 - Final Implementation**

    - `weekend_size_reduction=1`: CSV has reduced weekend positions → simulate enlarged for comparison ✅
    - `weekend_size_reduction=0`: CSV has normal positions → simulate reduced for comparison ✅
  - **Weekend Position Focus**: Only positions opened during weekend (Sat/Sun UTC) are affected by simulation ✅
  - **Weekday Positions**: Remain identical in both scenarios (no changes) ✅

- **YAML Configuration Enhancement:**
  - **Enhanced Configuration**: `weekend_analysis` section in `portfolio_config.yaml` ✅
