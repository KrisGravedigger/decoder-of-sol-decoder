üìã Coding Conventions
Structure and Organization

Maximum file length: 600 lines of code
When file exceeds 600 lines: time for refactoring (split into modules)
Naming: snake_case for functions/variables, PascalCase for classes

Documentation

Docstrings: Mandatory for all functions and classes
Docstring format: Google style with complete parameter and return value descriptions
Example:

pythondef fetch_price_history(pool_address: str, start_dt: datetime, end_dt: datetime) -> List[Dict]:
    """
    Fetch price history for a pool from Moralis API.
    
    Args:
        pool_address (str): Meteora pool address to fetch prices for
        start_dt (datetime): Start datetime for price range
        end_dt (datetime): End datetime for price range
        
    Returns:
        List[Dict]: Price data with 'timestamp' and 'close' keys
        
    Raises:
        requests.RequestException: When API call fails
        ValueError: When datetime range is invalid
    """
Anchor Comments (AI Navigation Comments)
Format: # [TAG]-[AI_ID]: [comment content] (max 120 characters)
Available tags:

# AIDEV-NOTE-CLAUDE: - important performance/business logic information
# AIDEV-TODO-CLAUDE: - planned improvements/tasks
# AIDEV-QUESTION-CLAUDE: - doubts to discuss with human
# AIDEV-NOTE-GEMINI: - information added by Gemini
# AIDEV-TODO-GEMINI: - tasks planned by Gemini

Anchor comment usage rules:

Before scanning files: always locate existing AIDEV-* anchors first
When modifying code: update related anchors
DO NOT remove AIDEV-NOTE without explicit human instruction
Add anchors when code is:

too long or complex
very important
confusing or potentially buggy
performance-critical



Usage examples:
python# AIDEV-NOTE-CLAUDE: perf-critical; Moralis API cache mechanism - avoid duplicate requests
def fetch_price_history(pool_address: str, start_dt: datetime, end_dt: datetime) -> List[Dict]:
    # Implementation...

# AIDEV-TODO-CLAUDE: add pool_address format validation (ticket: SOL-123)  
def validate_meteora_pool_address(address: str) -> bool:
    # Current implementation...

# AIDEV-QUESTION-CLAUDE: should timeframe selection be adaptive or fixed? 
# Context: current 10min/30min/1h/4h may not cover all use cases
def calculate_optimal_timeframe(duration_hours: float) -> str:
    # Timeframe selection logic...
Refactoring Rules at 600+ Lines

Extract business logic to separate modules (parsers/, analyzers/, utils/)
Create utils.py for helper functions (timestamp parsing, validation)
Separate layers (data extraction, price fetching, strategy simulation, reporting)
Add AIDEV-NOTE about refactoring reason

Business Logic vs Debug Features

Close reason classification: Core business logic in log_extractor.py (always active)
Context export: Debug feature in debug_analyzer.py (configurable)
Performance consideration: Business logic uses smaller context window (25 lines) vs debug export (80 lines)
Data completeness: All CSV data should be available regardless of debug settings

üö¶ Rules for Claude
üéØ You can do without asking

Add anchor comments with CLAUDE tag
Discuss LP strategy business logic (but don't implement without specification)
Implement according to specification when simulation parameters are clearly defined

‚ö†Ô∏è You can propose (but not implement)

Code refactoring - propose plan, wait for approval
API call optimizations - describe benefits, don't introduce automatically
Simulation algorithm improvements - discuss mathematics, don't change without permission
File structure changes - only with explicit permission

üö´ Absolute prohibitions

Don't assume LP strategy logic - Meteora DLMM parameters are specific, always ask
Don't implement Moralis API optimizations without consent (only propose)
Don't remove anchor comments without instructions
Don't change fee calculation logic - this is core business logic

üìã Change Implementation Process

First skeleton/plan of changes for discussion
After approval - complete code with precise "find and replace" instructions
Code changes: using "find and replace" method with exact location
New code: indicate exactly where to paste

üîÑ Refactoring (soft-stop at 600+ lines)

Suggest refactoring but allow continuation without it
When refactoring: check function by function that all functionalities are preserved
Format: "I suggest refactoring, but can continue without it if you prefer"

üìè File Length Monitoring

At 600+ lines: gently suggest refactoring with each modification
Don't block work if user decides to continue

üìñ Session Management Rules
üéØ Single Task Per Session

One session = one task (plus minor improvements if needed)
Never use same chat for multiple unrelated tasks
If human tries to start new task: remind about this rule (but don't force - not a hard stop)

üîî Task Completion Reminders

When task seems complete: remind human to test script and update CLAUDE.md
When human confirms testing: automatically suggest all CLAUDE.md updates needed

‚úÖ Session Closure Protocol

Human confirms testing completed: provide complete CLAUDE.md update suggestions
Focus on: Session History, Working Features, Project Status, any structural changes

Identified TP patterns: "Take profit triggered:" and "üéØ TAKEPROFIT!"
Simplified classification logic (TP/SL/LV/OOR/other)
Moved classification from debug_analyzer.py to log_extractor.py core logic
Added _classify_close_reason() method with optimized 25-line context window

2025-06-21: Major Refactoring & Enhanced Parsing

Goal: Fix syntax errors, refactor oversized files, improve strategy detection and close timestamps
Achieved:

Fixed syntax error in _parse_strategy_from_context() - incorrect indentation levels
Major refactoring - split 711-line log_extractor.py into modular structure:

Created models.py (~50 lines) - Position class
Created parsing_utils.py (~250 lines) - all parsing functions
Reduced log_extractor.py to ~430 lines
Updated debug_analyzer.py (~200 lines) - removed duplicate logic


Strategy detection improved to ~90% accuracy:

Added 3 pattern types: bracket format, text format, summary format
Added lookahead parameter for forward searching
Handles both "Spot (1-Sided)" and "Bid-Ask (Wide)" variants


Close timestamp extraction - no more "UNKNOWN" timestamps:

Extracts from close line or searches ¬±10 lines
Prioritizes backward search for relevance


CSV handling enhanced:

Append mode instead of overwrite
Duplicate detection by position_id
Chronological sorting by open_timestamp
Detailed statistics logging




Technical Changes:

Moved all parsing functions to parsing_utils.py
Each parsing function accepts debug_enabled parameter
Removed guess_close_reason() duplication from debug_analyzer
Better separation of concerns - business logic vs debug features
Maintained full compatibility with main_analyzer.py


Files Modified:

log_extractor.py (refactored from 711‚Üí430 lines)
debug_analyzer.py (updated, removed duplication)
models.py (new file)

Issues: All syntax and structural issues resolved ‚úÖ
Next Steps: Test the refactored system, then proceed with strategy performance analysis

2025-06-21: Step Size Detection Implementation

Goal: Add step size information (WIDE/SIXTYNINE/MEDIUM/NARROW) to strategy detection
Achieved:

Step size detection implemented - now extracts step size from bracket format logs
Parser prioritization fixed - bracket format (with step size) now checked before text format
Strategy output enhanced - results now show "Bid-Ask (1-Sided) SIXTYNINE", "Spot (1-Sided) WIDE", etc.
Function signature compatibility - resolved TypeError by removing conflicting parameters


Technical Changes:

Modified parse_strategy_from_context() in parsing_utils.py
Added two-pass search: first for bracket format, then text format as fallback
Added step size regex patterns: r'Step Size:\s*(WIDE|SIXTYNINE|MEDIUM|NARROW)'
Removed lookahead parameter to fix function call compatibility
Enhanced debug logging to track step size detection


Files Modified: parsing_utils.py (strategy parsing logic enhanced)
Issues: Parser prioritization and step size extraction working correctly ‚úÖ
Next Steps: Strategy performance analysis by step size and close reason combinations
