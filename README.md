# SOL Decoder Strategy Analyzer v2.0

A Python tool for analyzing SOL Decoder bot performance by extracting position data from bot logs and simulating alternative LP strategies on Meteora DLMM using research-based mathematical formulas and historical price data.

## Overview

This tool helps SOL Decoder bot users find optimal strategy combinations by:

1. **Extracting position data** from bot logs automatically
2. **Fetching historical price data** via Moralis API for each position
3. **Simulating alternative 1-sided strategies** using research-verified mathematical formulas
4. **Generating comprehensive reports** comparing Spot vs Bid-Ask distribution strategies

The tool analyzes **1-sided LP strategies** with different distribution patterns:
- **Spot Distribution**: Uniform liquidity across all bins
- **Bid-Ask Distribution**: U-shaped distribution (more liquidity at price edges)

Both strategies use research-based Meteora DLMM mathematical formulas with automatic step size detection (WIDE/MEDIUM/NARROW/SIXTYNINE).

## üÜï Version 2.0 Updates

**New in v2.0:**
- ‚úÖ **Research-verified accuracy**: Implemented mathematical formulas from official Meteora DLMM documentation
- ‚úÖ **U-shaped Bid-Ask distribution**: Uses proper `Weight(x) = Œ± √ó (x^Œ≤ + (1-x)^Œ≤)` formula
- ‚úÖ **Automatic step size processing**: Extracts and applies WIDE/MEDIUM/NARROW/SIXTYNINE from logs
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced safety**: Removed experimental 2-sided strategies, focus on proven 1-sided approaches
- ‚úÖ **Production ready**: Comprehensive error handling, validation, and documentation

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Tool Purpose & Proper Usage

**This tool is designed for comparative strategy analysis**, not precise financial predictions.

## Requirements

- Python 3.11+ (recommended for maximum compatibility)
- Moralis API key (free tier available)
- SOL Decoder bot log files

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/solana-lp-strategy-analyzer.git
cd solana-lp-strategy-analyzer
```

2. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the project root:
```env
MORALIS_API_KEY=your_moralis_api_key_here
```

## Usage

### 1. Prepare Your Data

Place your SOL Decoder bot log files in the `input/` directory. The tool automatically processes:
- Log files starting with "app" and containing ".log" in filename
- Standard SOL Decoder log format with timestamps and position events
- Position opening/closing events, PnL data, and strategy information
- Step size configurations (WIDE/MEDIUM/NARROW/SIXTYNINE)

**Note**: The log structure is specific to SOL Decoder bot output. You need actual bot logs to use this tool effectively.

### 2. Run the Analysis

Execute the main analyzer:
```bash
python main_analyzer.py
```

The tool will:
1. Extract position data from SOL Decoder logs ‚Üí `positions_to_analyze.csv`
2. Parse step size and strategy information automatically
3. Fetch Meteora pool price history for each position
4. Run strategy simulations using research-based mathematical formulas
5. Generate detailed reports in `detailed_reports/`
6. Create final summary with optimal strategies ‚Üí `final_analysis_report.csv`

### 3. Review Results

- **Individual Reports**: Check `detailed_reports/` for position-specific analysis
- **Summary Report**: Review `final_analysis_report.csv` for comparative results
- **Strategy Rankings**: Focus on which strategy (Spot vs Bid-Ask) performed better for each position
- **Logs**: Monitor console output for processing status and any issues

**Key Insight**: Look for patterns in when Bid-Ask outperforms Spot and vice versa. Results will help guide strategy selection for similar market conditions.

## Sample Results Interpretation

Example findings from real analysis:
- **Bid-Ask advantage**: 9 out of 61 positions (15%) showed better performance with Bid-Ask distribution
- **Spot advantage**: 52 out of 61 positions (85%) showed better performance with Spot distribution
- **Pattern analysis**: Consider market conditions, step sizes, and position duration for insights

**Your results may vary** based on:
- Different market conditions during your trading period
- Various step size configurations in your positions
- Pool-specific characteristics and trading patterns

## Output Files

## API Requirements

This tool requires a Moralis API key for fetching Solana/Meteora price data:

1. Sign up at [moralis.io](https://moralis.io)
2. Get your free API key from the dashboard  
3. Add it to your `.env` file as `MORALIS_API_KEY`

The tool automatically handles:
- Rate limiting (0.6s between requests)
- Response caching to minimize API usage
- Error handling for network issues

## Log Format Requirements

This tool is designed specifically for SOL Decoder bot logs. The bot generates logs with:

- Position opening events with strategy information (Spot/Bid-Ask, step sizes)
- Pool addresses for Meteora DLMM pairs
- Investment amounts and PnL calculations
- Timestamps in the format `v1.2.3-MM/DD-HH:MM:SS`

**Important**: You need actual SOL Decoder bot logs to use this analyzer. The log structure is specific to that bot's output format.

## Mathematical Foundation

The tool implements research-based formulas from official Meteora DLMM documentation:

### Bid-Ask Distribution (U-shaped)
```
Weight(x) = Œ± √ó (x^Œ≤ + (1-x)^Œ≤)
```
- More liquidity at price range edges
- Better for capturing volatility and range-bound price action

### Spot Distribution (Uniform)
```
Weight(x) = constant
```
- Even liquidity distribution across all bins
- Simpler strategy, good for steady trending markets

### Step Size Impact
- **WIDE**: ~50 bins, broader price coverage
- **MEDIUM**: ~20 bins, moderate range
- **NARROW**: 1-10 bins, tight price focus  
- **SIXTYNINE**: 69 bins, maximum range

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**No positions extracted:**
- Verify you're using actual SOL Decoder bot log files
- Check that files start with "app" and contain ".log"
- Ensure the bot logs contain position opening/closing events

**API errors:**
- Verify your Moralis API key is correct
- Check network connectivity
- Monitor rate limiting (tool includes automatic delays)

**Invalid dates:**
- The tool handles some date edge cases automatically
- Check that your SOL Decoder logs have valid timestamps

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by modifying debug settings in `log_extractor.py`:
```python
DEBUG_ENABLED = True
DEBUG_LEVEL = "DEBUG"
```
